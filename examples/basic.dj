# Basic Djot Syntax

This document demonstrates the fundamental building blocks of Djot markup.

## Headings

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Paragraphs

This is a simple paragraph. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
Multiple lines in the same paragraph are joined together.

This is a second paragraph. It's separated from the first by a blank line.

You can have hard line breaks\
by using a backslash before the newline.

## Emphasis and Strong

This is _emphasized text_ (typically rendered as italic).

This is *strong text* (typically rendered as bold).

You can combine them: _emphasized with *strong inside*_.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

### Ordered Lists

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

### Task Lists

- [ ] Unchecked task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Another unchecked task

## Block Quotes

> This is a block quote.
> It can span multiple lines.

> Block quotes can contain other elements:
>
> - Lists
> - _Emphasis_
> - And more

## Thematic Breaks

Use three or more dashes or asterisks for a horizontal rule:

---

Content after the break.

***

Another break with asterisks.

## Code

Inline code uses backticks: `let x = 42;`

For code with backticks inside, use double backticks: ``let str = `template`;``
